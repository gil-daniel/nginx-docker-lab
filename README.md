![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

A hands-on Docker project that sets up a custom NGINX container with persistent volumes and orchestration using Docker Compose. Built and deployed on an Ubuntu VM hosted in Azure, as part of a personal DevOps/SRE learning journey.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How to create and build a custom Docker image with NGINX
- How to bind a local directory as a volume to persist website content
- How to use Docker Compose for local container orchestration
- How to expose and access services through specific ports
- How to configure NSG (Network Security Group) rules in Azure

## ⚙️ How to Run

### Option 1: Run with Docker CLI and volume

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name nginx-volume \
  -p 8082:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/site:/usr/share/nginx/html \
  nginx
```
Then open: http://your-vm-ip:8082
________________________________________
Option 2: Run with Docker Compose
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Then open: http://your-vm-ip:8083

🔐 Make sure the corresponding ports (8082, 8083) are allowed in your Azure NSG rules.
________________________________________
🌍 Environment
* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Azure VM)
* Docker CE + Docker Compose
* NGINX (official image)
* Git + GitHub
________________________________________
🏁 Next Steps (Ideas)
* Add backend container (e.g. Node.js or Python) to compose file
* Add named volumes and test persistence across rebuilds
* Host this static site via HTTPS using NGINX + Let's Encrypt
* Publish image to Docker Hub
* Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
* Deploy the stack to AKS or Azure Container Apps

## ✅ Project Status

This project has reached its initial goal as a self-contained NGINX container lab and has been marked as complete for version 1.0.0. While future enhancements (such as CI/CD, HTTPS, and backend orchestration) are noted, no further updates are currently planned. Feel free to fork and expand it. Thanks for following along!
